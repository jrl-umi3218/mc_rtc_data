jvrc_description
================

This package contains the robot description for the JVRC-1 robot.

This robot is a virtual robot initially created for the JVRC competition. The original VRML model can be retrieved from [github](https://github.com/jvrc/model). This model was initially obtained using [simtrans](https://github.com/fkanehiro/simtrans).

The URDF model in this package corresponds to [the VRML model in mc_openrtm](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/mc_openrtm/tree/master/projects/JVRC1/model/JVRC1). Compared to the original model, the grippers are wider so that they are more suitable for manipulation.
